functions that send back a value and later be resumed by picking up where they left off. Such functions are called generator functions
```python
def pi_series():
    sum = 0
```
```python
>>> def bank_account(deposited, interest_rate):
...    while True:
...        calculated_interest = interest_rate * deposited 
...        received = yield calculated_interest
...        if received:
...            deposited += received
            
>>> my_account = bank_account(1000,0.05)
>>> first_year_interest = next(my_account)
>>> first_year_interest
50.0
>>> next_year_interest = my_account.send(first_year_interest + 1000)
>>> next_year_interest
102.5
```
